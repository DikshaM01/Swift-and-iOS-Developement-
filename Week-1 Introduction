->Swift is a powerful and inituitive programming language developed by Apple.
-> It is designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa touch framework
Why Choose Swift?

1. Safe & Easy to Read: Swift's syntax and language constructions eliminate the types of unsafe code classes often found in C and Objective-C.

2. Fast & Powerful: Swift code is performance-optimized and can compete with C++ for computation algorithms.

3. Interoperability: Swift is designed to coexist with the Objective-C language, allowing you to incorporate Objective-C files into Swift projects and vice versa.

4. Memory Management: Swift uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) for memory management, making it easier for developers

Variables-> using var keyword for example varmyvar=10
var keyword is used to declare variables
Consonants->value cannot be changed once it will get set . declared using let keyword
             for example let  myconstant=20
->you must initialize the consonants
Data Types: 
1. Integers: Int keyword -> let myInt:Int=10
2. Double and Floats: Double has a precision of at least 15 decimal digits, whereas the precision of Float can be as little as 6 decimal digits.
   For example var myDouble:Double=3.14
3.Booleans: let orangesareorange:Bool=true
4.Strings:var hello:String="hello, world"

print("Hello, World!") 
->In Swift, we cannot change the type of a variable once it's declared.
-> Initialization
   var sitename:String
   sitename='diksha'
   print(sitename)

->var siteName = "programiz.com"

->for naming the variable we can use letter,underscore or dollar,not with numbers


// create character type variable
var letter: Character = "s"

print(letter)

// Output: s

If we don't assign any value to a boolean variable, it takes false as its default value.
->swift is case sensitive , a and A are different
We use the append() function to join two strings in Swift
var greet = "Hello "
var name = "Jack"

// using the append() method
greet.append(name)
print(greet)
let message = "Hello, World!"

// count length of a string
print(message.count) // 13  Note: The count property counts the total number of characters in a string including whitespaces.

isEmpty
					determines if a string is empty or not
			

			
				capitalized
					capitalizes the first letter of every word in a string
			

			
				uppercased()
					converts string to uppercase
			

			
				lowercase()
					converts string to lowercase
			

			
				hasPrefix()
					determines if a string starts with certain characters or not
			

			
				hasSuffix()
					determines if a string ends with certain characters or not

->Escape Sequence-it is used to escape from the characters.
    var example="This is \"String\" class"
   print(example)

\0
					null
			

			
				\\
					plain backslash
			

			
				\t
					a horizontal tab
			

			
				\n
					line feed
			

			
				\"
					double quote

->we can also use the backslash operator '\' to use variables and constants inside a string 
  for example-> let name="swift"
                var message="this is \(name) programming" -> this is swift programming
                print(message)
-> multiline using """ quotes-> always begin with a new line

->var str = String()

-> print() function is taking a single parameter 
   print(items:separator:terminator:)
   items->values inside the double quotation
   separator-> this is optional , allows us to separate multiple items print()
  terminator-> this is also optional,allows us to add specific values like "\n" and "\t"

var name:Double=10.6
print(number) ->10.6

->concatenated strings-> print("programiz is"+"awesome")-> programiz is aweosome

readLine() is the method by which we can take the input and output ..
print("enter your fav food")
let name=readLine()
print("my fav food is \name")
